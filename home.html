      <h1>Kanyakumari(Southern tip of India)</h1>
      <img src="https://www.tamilnadutourism.tn.gov.in/img/pages/large-desktop/kanyakumari-1654195391_647a9f0be327c6e5ec25.webp" alt="kanyakumari">
      <p>Kanyakumari, a place where one can ever witness the most captivating sunrise and sunset. It is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu that lies at the Southern tip of India, and it is where the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean meet. Beautiful.</p>

      <h2>Vivekananda Rock Memorial</h2>
      <p>(Opening hours 8:00 am – 4:00 pm all days of the week). 
        The main reason why everybody travels to Kanyakumari is to see this beauty. The memorial stands at a distance of 400 m offshore and is easily accessible by ferry from the mainland. Ticket price – INR 20 per person for the general queue and INR 170 for VIP queue. However, buying tickets in the VIP counter do not grant a special ferry ride. We all get to board the same ferry.
         The only advantage is queue in the VIP counter is always a lot shorter than the general queue and it saves energy.</p>

      </ul>
      <h2>Thiruvalluvar Statue </h2>
      <p>
        (Opening hours 8:00 am – 4:00 pm). The view of the sea from the top of this statue is surreal. 
        It is a tall stone sculpture of the Tamil poet and philosopher Valluvar, author of the Tirukkural, an ancient Tamil work on secular, ethics and morality. This statue stands close to Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The ferry which takes you to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial would take you to this statue as well. So, you do not require to buy a separate ferry ticket for an entry to this statue. Sometimes, due to high tides the entry may be closed sooner than 4:00 pm. 
        I recommend visiting this statue in the early morning hours to avoid closure of entry due to high tides.

      <h2>Vattakottai Fort</h2>
      <p>
        Opening hours (8:00 am – 5.00 pm. No Entry Fee). Vattakottai Fort is a seaside fort and located around 7 km away from Kanyakumari. 
        It is located in the Agasteeswaram Taluk. 
        You can hire a cab or an auto-rickshaw (popularly known as tuk-tuk) from Kanyakumari to reach the fort.
         For those who want to travel by bus, there are many buses that ply from Kanyakumari to Vattakottai. We hired an auto-rickshaw from Kanyakumari to reach the fort and paid around 350 INR to and fro.
         You can also see windmills at a distance from this fort.

      <h2>Sunrise and Sunset</h2>
      <p>
        (Sunrise 6:30 am, Sunset 6:30 pm). 
        Planning a trip to Kanyakumari, have you included Sunrise and Sunset in your ”to-see” list? If not, your Kanyakumari trip is incomplete.
         You can watch sunrise and sunset from the shore overlooking Vivekananda Memorial and Thiruvalluvar Statue. 
         The most beautiful part of our trip was waking up early and chasing sunrise. 
         We also ensured to chase sunsets every evening.
          You can see the sun slowly rising out of the sea during sunrise, and the sun going down the sea during sunsets. One can really feel connected to nature watching this beauty. I am tough, but I may sound too dramatic for saying this and I can’t help; I almost had tears in my eyes and got goosebumps seeing the sun rising out. After all, the most beautiful things in life are for free, right? Those beauties are one of the examples.
         Sunsets are pretty alike and worth chasing for.

      <h2>Our Lady of Ransom Church </h2>
      <p>
        10 minutes walk away from the above mentioned three attractions, there lies a beautiful Our Lady of Ransom Church. 
        On entering the church one can see a beautiful statue of Mother Mary and clad in a sari – like and a little Cross on the altar.

      <h2>Experiences that Enrich Your Soul</h2>
    <p>Kanyakumari offers a multitude of experiences that go beyond sightseeing. Here's a glimpse:</p>
      <p> I have shared all the places which I personally visited. 
        If you intend on staying for more days you can explore more places around Kanyakumari.
         My trip was a short one: 3 days and 2 nights.
          On the third day, we could not do anything much as we had to check out early from our hotel room and head towards Nagercoil to board a bus back to Pondicherry. We did walk around Nagercoil for quite a while though. We were a group of three people. We feel extremely satisfied to have taken this trip. Our entire budget was 3000 INR per person (includes everything).
         Well, I am sure now you have Kanyakumari in mind on your next travel list.</p>
